                    <p> Perhaps not relevant to the world of tech, but I did a certificate at Ironman University to
                        coach triathletes. Although I am passionate about the world of tech, I am so too about Triathlon
                        ! </p>
                    <p> Here I worked in team format with athletes but also did so individually. Tailor made programs
                        were made for the athletes based on their goals and needs.</p>

                    <p> I was a teacher in Asia from 2015-2019 and I returned to Taiwan in 2022. </p>
                    <p> While teaching English, I have been busy with Software Development studies on fourms such as
                        CodeCademy and Udemy and lastly upon arriving in Taiwan I decided to
                        join something more official and chose CodeSPace</p>

                    <p class="h3"> Platform 45 </p>

                    <p>I worked at Platform 45 as an AI Labeller on contract basis to help a team of developers train
                        the AI that they developed.</p>
                    <p>After the AI labelling I did a Rails internship. Although I was learning a lot and moving forward
                        and completed some projects, I was moving to slow due to not knowing Ruby well enough. I needed
                        more time
                        and hence decided to stop the intership and move over into the software studies at CodeSpace
                        while working in Asia.</p>
                    <p> Platform 45 was a great company to work for. </p>

                    <p>Briefly stated before, I was a triathlon coach. My focus was on helping athletes to develop a
                        good swimming technique.
                        I also helped with the cycling and running of the athletes. We were a team of coaches that had
                        different expertise and we
                        used these expertise to coach athletes as best we could for different races. Tailor made
                        programs were available on request as well.

                    <p>I enjoyed working for Polar due to the culture and atmosphere that the leadership created over
                        time. </p>
